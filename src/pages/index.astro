    answer: "We offer simple car ribbon decoration, bridal car ribbon and bows, full fresh flower wedding car decoration, dulha & dulhan car setups, barat car decoration, black car wedding decoration, pastel themes, 4x4 wedding car décor (Fortuner, Sportage etc.) and luxury Audi / BMW / Mercedes wedding car designs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide \"car decoration for wedding near me\" in my area?",
    answer: "Yes. We cover most areas of Lahore including College Road, Township, Johar Town, Wapda Town, Bahria Town, DHA, Model Town, Gulberg, Cantt, Garden Town and nearby societies. Share your exact location on WhatsApp and we'll confirm service."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does wedding car decoration cost in Lahore?",
    answer: "Simple car decoration with ribbon and ready-made wedding car bows starts from around Rs 2,500. Fresh flower bridal car decoration usually starts from Rs 5,000–7,000 depending on car size, flower choice and design. Packages for multiple barat cars or luxury cars (BMW, Audi, Fortuner) are priced after we know your details."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose between artificial and fresh flowers for my wedding car?",
    answer: "Yes. Most couples prefer fresh flower car decoration with roses, motia and seasonal flowers, but we also offer artificial flower options for long routes or if you want a lower budget. We'll show you sample photos for both."
  },
  {
    question: "Which flowers are commonly used for wedding car decorations in Lahore?",
    answer: "Red and white roses, baby's-breath, gypsophila, motia gajras, marigold (genda) and seasonal mixed flowers are the most popular. For pastel themes we use peach, pink and cream flowers to match your bridal dress and ribbons."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you decorate all car models – Alto, Civic, Audi, BMW, Fortuner, Baleno, Brezza, Bolero, Kia Sportage, etc.?",
    answer: "Yes, we regularly decorate small cars like Alto and Mehran, sedans like Civic, City and Corolla, crossovers like Sportage and BR-V, 4x4s like Fortuner and Prado, and luxury cars including Audi, BMW and Mercedes. We adjust the design to the shape of each vehicle so it looks balanced from every angle."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you do black car decoration for wedding?",
    answer: "Of course. Black wedding car decoration is very popular in Lahore. We usually create a strong contrast with red or white flowers and gold or silver wedding car ribbons and bows so the design stands out in photos."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer simple, budget-friendly \"car decoration for marriage simple\"?",
    answer: "Yes. If you just want a neat look without heavy flowers, we recommend a simple package with car ribbon decoration, a central bonnet bouquet and a few side accents. It keeps the car elegant and is easy on the budget."
  },
  {
    question: "How early should I book wedding car decoration services in Lahore?",
    answer: "For peak wedding months, it's best to book at least 1–2 weeks in advance, especially if you need multiple cars or luxury models. Last-minute bookings are possible if our team is free, but early booking secures your time slot and best price."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize my wedding car decoration theme?",
    answer: "Yes, every bridal car design is customizable. You can choose colours, type of flowers, level of coverage (simple, medium, full) and add details like name ribbons, initials, bride & groom tags or special messages."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide eco-friendly wedding car decoration in Lahore?",
    answer: "We can use more natural materials like fresh flowers, fabric ribbons and biodegradable tape instead of plastic items where possible. If you specifically want eco-friendly options, tell us on WhatsApp and we'll design accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you also decorate barat and family cars or only the main bridal car?",
    answer: "We decorate all cars – dulha car, dulhan car, parents' cars and barati cars. Many families choose one premium bridal car decoration and simple ribbon car decor for the rest of the barat line."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you combine wedding car decoration with other wedding decoration services?",
    answer: "Yes, we can provide package deals for multiple cars including dulha car, dulhan car, barat cars, and family cars. We can also coordinate with your venue decoration team to match themes and colors. Share what you need and we'll send a combined quote for all your car decoration needs."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide groom car decor and \"dulha car decoration\" for baraat departure?",
    answer: "Yes. Groom car decoration is one of our most requested services. We design dulha car flower arrangements that look strong in videos when the barat leaves the street and arrives at the hall."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book wedding car decoration online?",
    answer: "You can message us on WhatsApp with your date, area, car model and reference photos. We'll suggest 2–3 designs with prices. Once you confirm, we take a small advance and reserve your time slot. On the wedding day our team arrives at the agreed location to decorate the car."
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I see reviews of your wedding car decoration service in Lahore?",
    answer: "You can view photos, client messages and reviews on our WhatsApp and social pages. When you contact us, we'll share real screenshots from Lahore couples who've used our dulha, dulhan and barat car decoration service."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide car decoration for Christian, Hindu or Bengali weddings in Lahore?",
    answer: "Yes. We work with all communities and can match your cultural style – from simple cross-style car bouquets for Christian weddings to traditional genda and red-gold themes for Pakistani and Bengali weddings."
  },
  {
    question: "What if it rains on my wedding day – will the car decoration be okay?",
    answer: "For rainy days we suggest slightly tighter designs and stronger fixing methods. We avoid very heavy vertical arrangements and use flowers that handle weather better. If forecast is very bad, we'll guide you on safer decoration options."
