    question: "What is the price of wedding room decoration in Lahore?",
    answer: "Our simple wedding room decoration at home starts from Rs 6,000 and romantic first-night or luxury honeymoon decoration can go from Rs 9,500+. Final price depends on area in Lahore, timing, flowers, lights and design. Share your location and a photo or reference and we'll send exact options on WhatsApp."
  },
  {
    question: "Which areas of Lahore do you cover for wedding room decoration?",
    answer: "We decorate wedding rooms in Lahore across DHA, Cantt, Bahria Town, NFC, Model Town, Faisal Town, Township, Johar Town, Wapda Town, Garden Town, Gulberg and nearby areas. If you're slightly outside these zones, message us on WhatsApp and we'll confirm."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you decorate rooms at home, hotels or guest houses?",
    answer: "Yes. We provide wedding room decoration at home in Lahore, hotel rooms and guest houses, as long as the location allows outside decorators to enter at your booked time."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer low-budget wedding room decoration packages?",
    answer: "Yes. We have low-budget wedding room decoration options with rose petals, simple flower work and fairy lights so you still get a special first-night setup without spending too much. Tell us your budget and we'll suggest designs accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use fresh flowers or artificial flowers?",
    answer: "Our main designs use fresh flowers for the bed, petals and vases. We can also mix some artificial flower decoration for backdrops or masehri if you want to reduce cost or need the décor to stay fresh for many hours."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the colours, flowers and theme?",
    answer: "Yes. You can send us wedding room decoration ideas, Pinterest screenshots, AI images or examples from Instagram, and we'll match or adapt the design based on your budget and flower availability in Lahore."
  },
  {
    question: "How early should I book my wedding room decoration?",
    answer: "If your date is fixed, it's best to book 3–7 days before the event. For very busy seasons (Shaadi / Baraat peak days), even earlier is better. For same-day wedding room decoration in Lahore, message us on WhatsApp and we'll confirm only if a team is free."
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to decorate the room?",
    answer: "Most wedding night room decoration setups take around 1–2 hours, depending on design and size of the room. We coordinate time with your family to make sure the couple doesn't see the room before it's ready."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I book and pay?",
    answer: "You can book through WhatsApp or the Order Now form. Usually we take a small advance (JazzCash/Bank Transfer) to confirm your slot and the remaining amount in cash or transfer after the decoration is completed."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you also decorate for anniversary and honeymoon stays?",
    answer: "Yes. Our anniversary room decoration and honeymoon bedroom decoration options are very popular for surprise celebrations in Lahore. Just mention if it's an anniversary, welcome-back, honeymoon or first-night, and we'll style the message and décor accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I decorate a wedding room at home on a low budget?",
    answer: "Focus on three elements: Bed decoration with petals (heart shape, border or simple scatter), One wall or headboard with fairy lights, A few flower points (side tables, dressing or entrance). Even with limited budget, this gives a clean, romantic simple wedding room decoration at home."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best colour theme for wedding room decoration?",
    answer: "The most requested themes in Lahore are: Red & gold – classic romantic first-night look, White & pastel pink/peach – soft, elegant bridal vibe, All-red roses – strong, dramatic wedding night room. The best theme depends on the bedsheet colour, wall colour and the couple's taste."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I make wedding room decoration look romantic but not overdone?",
    answer: "Use flowers + lights + 1 focal point instead of filling every corner. A beautiful bed design with petals, a clean fairy light wall and a few candles or lamps give a romantic look without feeling crowded or cheap."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between bridal room decoration and wedding night decoration?",
    answer: "Bridal room decoration usually focuses on masehri / saij design, backdrop, cushions and the whole room for daytime photos. Wedding night / first-night decoration focuses more on the bed, lights and mood when the couple arrives at night. Most families in Lahore now choose both: daytime bridal room + night-time romantic setup."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I decorate a small bedroom for the wedding night?",
    answer: "For small rooms, avoid heavy structures. Instead: Use wall fairy lights behind the bed, Create a petal path from the door to the bed, Add small flower vases or jars instead of big stands. Small spaces look very good in photos if the bed and wall behind it are decorated nicely."
  },
  {
    question: "What items are needed for wedding room decoration?",
    answer: "Basic wedding room decoration items include: Fresh flowers (roses, baby's breath, gypso, etc.), Petals for bed and floor, Fairy lights and/or lamps, Candles or LED candles, Ribbons, fabric, tape, pins (for masehri / backdrop), Optional: balloons, banners, initials or name lights. When you book with Lahore Blooms, we bring all the required items for the chosen design."
  },
  {
    question: "Which is better: fresh flower or artificial flower room decoration?",
    answer: "Fresh flowers look and smell better in real life and photos, but last fewer hours. Artificial flowers work well for backdrops or when the setup must stay for a long time or in very hot rooms. Most couples choose a mix: fresh flowers for bed and close shots, artificial for some background elements."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I reuse some of the wedding room decoration for the next morning or photos?",
    answer: "Yes. Many couples keep part of the flower room decoration (vases, some petals and the backdrop) for next-morning photos. Just remove petals from the bed when you want to sleep comfortably, and keep the rest for morning pictures."
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in your bridal / wedding room decoration packages in Lahore?",
    answer: "Our packages include complete room styling: backdrop, flowers, balloons (if selected), LED fairy lights, candles or lamps, bed styling, side tables, and entrance décor. You choose the design from our catalog, and we handle everything from setup to clean finish, so the room is ready when the bride arrives."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer emergency or last-minute bridal room decoration services in Lahore?",
    answer: "Yes, we try our best to help with emergency bridal room decoration. If your decorator cancelled or you decided late, contact us with your location and room photos. If our team is free, we can arrange a fast setup with limited but beautiful options."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get custom themes like royal, modern, or traditional Pakistani bridal room décor?",
    answer: "Yes. We create royal, modern minimal, romantic, and traditional Pakistani bridal room themes with colors like red, maroon, gold, blush pink, white, and more. You can also share your own reference pictures—we'll adapt the theme to your room size and budget."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide lights, candles, and LED options for bridal room decoration in Lahore?",
    answer: "Yes, lighting is a big part of our designs. We use warm LED fairy lights, lamps, candles (real or LED), and sometimes neon text signs depending on the package. If you want a soft, romantic lighting look or a bright, Instagram-style setup, we can design it accordingly."
  },
  {
    question: "Is setup and removal included in the bridal room decoration price?",
    answer: "Yes. Our team comes, sets up the full decoration, and explains which items are returnable (like stands, frames, some props). After the event—either the same night or next day as agreed—we collect the rental items. This service is included in the package price unless otherwise mentioned."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I see your previous bridal room decoration work before booking?",
    answer: "Of course. We have a portfolio of real bridal room decorations in Lahore with before/after pictures. You can view them on our website gallery and we can also send recent work samples directly on WhatsApp so you feel confident about the result."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer discounts or special offers on bridal room decoration in Lahore?",
    answer: "Sometimes we run seasonal or combo offers, especially if you book bridal room + car decoration + bouquet together. For the latest discounts or packages, just send us a message on WhatsApp and we'll share any active deals."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I contact you for bridal room decoration in Lahore?",
